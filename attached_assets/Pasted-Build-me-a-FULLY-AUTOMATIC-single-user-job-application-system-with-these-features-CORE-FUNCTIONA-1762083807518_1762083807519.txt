Build me a FULLY AUTOMATIC single-user job application system with these features:

CORE FUNCTIONALITY:
1. Connect to my Gmail account using Gmail API

2. Monitor for job alert emails from MULTIPLE sources:
   - LinkedIn job alerts (from "LinkedIn Job Alerts" or jobs-listings@linkedin.com)
   - Seek NZ job alerts (from "noreply@seek.co.nz" or "job-alerts@seek.co.nz")
   - Any other job alert emails (make it flexible to add more sources later)

3. Parse emails from each platform to extract:
   - Job title
   - Company name
   - Location
   - Job description/snippet
   - Job URL (LinkedIn URL or Seek URL)
   - Posted date
   - Source platform (LinkedIn, Seek, etc.)
   - Salary info (if available)

4. CRITICAL FILTER - Auto-reject before analysis:
   - Automatically reject and skip any job with "visa sponsorship" in the title
   - Automatically reject and skip any job with "sponsorship" in the title
   - Mark these as "auto-rejected - sponsorship in title"
   - Don't waste AI credits analyzing these jobs

5. Store all extracted jobs in SQLite database with fields:
   - Job details (title, company, location, description, url)
   - Source platform (LinkedIn, Seek NZ, etc.)
   - Date received
   - Status (new, analyzing, applied, auto-rejected)
   - Rejection reason (if auto-rejected)
   - AI match score percentage (0-100%)
   - Application date/time if applied
   - Notes

6. Create a web dashboard that shows:
   - All jobs from ALL alert sources
   - Filter by source platform (LinkedIn, Seek, Both)
   - Filter by status and match score
   - View application history
   - See generated cover letters
   - Statistics (total applications, filtered for sponsorship, success rate, etc.)

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Use Python with Gmail API
- Use Flask for web framework
- Use SQLite for database
- Simple, clean UI with Tailwind CSS
- Add authentication so only I can access (single user only)
- Check for new emails every 30 minutes automatically
- Run application workflow automatically without human intervention

IMPORTANT: 
- This is a SINGLE-USER system (not multi-tenant, just for me)
- ALWAYS filter out "visa sponsorship" jobs BEFORE AI analysis
- Handle different email formats from LinkedIn vs Seek NZ
- LinkedIn often sends digest emails with multiple jobs
- Seek NZ usually sends individual job alerts
- Don't process the same job twice (check if URL already exists)
- Make the email parser flexible to handle variations in format
- Add visual badges/tags showing "LinkedIn" or "Seek NZ" source
- Process everything automatically - NO approval workflow needed

Build this step by step and test that Gmail connection and email parsing works correctly.
